					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>Aloe vera, also known as aloe barbadenis is a plant similar to a cactus that thrives in hot, dry weather.
                        Native to southern border regions of the United States and the Middle East, this plant has been used in a variety of applications for millenia. 
                        Ancient inhabitants of places like Mexico, China, Egypt, and the Middle East revered the plant for it's versatility. Aloe vera was first formally indentified in the western world by
                        Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Despite that Europeans had been aware of this mighty plant for centuries. Voyagers in the 15th century such as Columbus grew the plant on their ships to heal the wounds of their mercenaries.</p>
